# Exercises 1

## 1.1

Take a look at the `/data/top50.js`. It contain data on the top 50 songs streamed on Spotify.

We want to render this on our website.

In order to do this, you will need to

- create a file called `top50.ejs ` in `views/pages/`.
- add in the `header` and `footer` partials. (look over these files and see what they contain).
- create a `get` endpoint for the following path: `/top50`.
- the function called at this enpoint to use `res.render()`. (you can write your function directly inside of `server.js`)
- pass the title to the page: "Top 50 Songs Streamed on Spotify" via the render method.
- It would be good if our title was where the word "Workshop" is at the moment, as well as in the `<head>` of the page as a `<title>`.
- Pass those values to the partials via the render method.

Once you've completed 1.1, you should have something like this.

## 1.2

Time to add some data to the page.

- We are requiring the `top50` file at the top of `server.js`. You have access to the file in there.
- Pass the array to the `top50.ejs`.
- Render the list on the page (only the rank and title for  now).
- This data is a list. Make sure to use the proper HTML tags. 🙏

Once you've completed 1.1 and 1.2, you should have something like this.

## 1.3

It is better practice to split our code into _partials_ that have only one job to do. 

- Move the rendering of the `<li>` for the song to its own file in `/views/partials` call it `song.ejs`.
- Once you've done that, you can add more song data to the page. Add the rest of the data provided. (`rank`, `title`, `artist`, `streams`, `publicationDate`).

## 1.4

Time to style the `<li>`s to be a little more readable / presentable.

- we have upgraded to `scss`, from `css`. 
- Look inside the `scss` folder. There is already a `_song.scss` file in there. It is being imported into `styles.scss` and then compiled into the `public/css/styles.css`. **Do not modify anything `public`.
- Write your css in `_song.scss`. Save and reload the page sporadically to check on your progress. You should have something like this below.

## 1.5 (Hard... remember the desserts)

- Create a new endpoint `/top50/popular-artist`
- create a function that will render the songs of the most popular artist on the list.
- pass only those songs to the `ejs` page.
- reuse the song partial to render the songs.

## 1.6 

It would be great if each song could have its own page. How do you feel about creating 50 endpoints in `server.js`?

You would start with `/top50/song/1` and end with `top50/song/50`...

No! We ain't doing that, but I would still like to be able to access each individual song that way...

- Create one endpoint using a url parameter in your endpoint
- Page title should be "Song #"
- Create a box like in the screenshot below.
- Use `_song-page.scss` for your styling.

## 1.7 

Try navigating to a url for a song that is ranked above 50, below 1. What happens? Our server borks and can't serve a page that doesn't exist.

- fix that.

Once fixed, it should show us the 404 page instead of breaking.

## 1.8 Challenge / Extra

- Add arrows, buttons, or anything you like to the individual song pages that enable user to quickly navigate the list. e.g. If I am on song rank #22, clicking 'next' will take me to song rank #23, etc.
