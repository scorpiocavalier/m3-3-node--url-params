# 3.2 Node.Js: Foundations

## Setup

1. Open a terminal window and type `yarn install`
2. Start up the server by typing `yarn dev`

## Workshop

The exercises are in the the `__workshop` folder.

⚠️ But before you start them, you will have to fix the server, I think. Somehow, things got a little messed up and it won't run until the bugs are squashed.

## Getting stuck?

🚨 It wil be better to **not** look at the solutions.

If you get stuck, it will be better to see a TC.

The solution is a complete solution to _all_ of the questions and looking at it before you finish might confuse more than help you.
